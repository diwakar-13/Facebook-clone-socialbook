Facebook Clone – SocialBook

This is a simple Facebook-style clone built for learning and portfolio purposes.
It includes Login, Signup, and a Home Page, all connected through a small Node.js + Express server.
The UI is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. When a user opens the website, they see the Login Page.
2. If they don’t have an account, they go to the Signup Page.
3. After signing up, they return to the Login Page.
4. After logging in successfully, they go to the Home Page (index.html).
5. The backend server (server.js) controls these page redirects.
6. All the files like HTML, CSS, JS, and images are inside the public folder.

This project does not use a real database.
It only shows how the page flow works in a full-stack website.
